# Rail_Connect
Rail Connect is a C-based train reservation system that automates booking, cancellation, and waitlist handling using core data structures for speed and reliability. It uses arrays, linked lists, queues, and stacks, with simple file storage for persistence
Focus: Faster processing, optimized seat allocation, and better user experience.

Core modules: Booking, cancellation, search/display, waitlist, undo.

Data structures: Arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks.

Persistence: File handling for records across runs.

Outcome: Functional prototype demonstrating real-world DSA use.
